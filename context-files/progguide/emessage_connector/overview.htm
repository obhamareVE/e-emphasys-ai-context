            <p class="Paragraph">The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector is defined between a
               Baan messaging-enabled application and one or more providers.
               A provider is a third party software package. The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage
               Connector environment is depicted in the figure shown
               above.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector relies on the following
               Infor ERP Enterprise products:

               <li class="ListItem">Baan 4GL Development tools</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Paragraph">The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector has a relationship with
               the underlying provider. Examples of providers which could be
               supported are:
            </p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem">Microsoft Exchange</li>

                  <p class="Paragraph">The 4GL process represents any Baan 4GL process which
                     needs to communicate with another process which is not
                     located in the same Baan Virtual Machine (BVM). This external
                     process is usually a third party messaging based software (eg. Microsoft
                     Outlook). This 4GL process can be sending messages to an
                     external process, processing incoming messages or both.

                  <div class="subSectionTitle">Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector DLL</div>
                  <p class="Paragraph">The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector DLL is a 4GL DLL which
                     can be used by any Baan process to create, send and receive
                     message objects. Baan processes wishing to use the Infor ERP Enterprise
                     eMessage Connector must utilize this DLL. The DLL contains
                     functions for the creation, examination and transport of
                     message objects. The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector DLL
                     accesses the Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector Repository to
                     determine the available message types and connectors to
                     handle those message types. When a Baan process wishes to
                     send a message, the Baan eMessage Connector DLL examines the
                     repository to determine the appropriate connector needed to
                     handle the message and starts it.
                  </p>
                  <p class="Paragraph">This dll can be linked to a script by adding the following
                     line:
                  </p><pre class="CodeBlock">

                  <p class="Paragraph">The Baan eMessage Connector acts as the
                     intermediary between the 4GL process and the provider. When
                     started it examines the Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage 
                     Connector Repository to determine how to connect to the
                     external provider and establishes a connection. From then on
                     it handles the transport of the message objects between the
                     4GL process and the external provider. It also performs
                     message logging. All messages passing through the connector
                     are logged to the Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector Repository
                     log table and the individual message parts are stored in the
                     file system. This ensures traceability. The storage of
                     message objects as files is also important for Baan 4GL
                     applications. The Baan 4GL does not allow the allocation of
                     large memory areas for processing BLOBs (Binary Large
                     Objects) and other large objects. The message log therefore
                     allows the Baan applications to digest these large files in
                     smaller chunks (by reading them from the file system in small
                     pieces).

               <p class="Paragraph">A number of steps must be executed in order for a Baan
                  process to send a message to a provider. First, the Baan
                  process creates the message using the Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage
                  Connector DLL functions. Next the Baan process instructs the
                  Baan eMessage Connector DLL to send the message using a
                  particular service. A Baan eMessage Connector Service is
                  associated with a connector which provides the actual
                  service. The Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector DLL accesses the
                  Infor ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector repository to
                  determine the appropriate connector to be used to process the
                  message object. This connector is then started and the
                  message object passed to it. The connector accesses the Infor
                  ERP Enterprise eMessage Connector repository to determine the
                  appropriate parameters to be used to connect to the provider.
                  Connection is established to the provider and the message
                  sent. The appropriate message logging is also performed.

               <div class="subSectionTitle">Inbound Message Handling</div>
               <p class="Paragraph">Inbound message handling involves invoking the appropriate
      connector and having it wait for messages with a particular
      address. The startup parameters specify the messages the
      connector should handle. The connector is always started by a
      4GL message enabled application. Command line invocation can
      be achieved by using the 4GL application as a parameter to
      the bshell on startup. Incoming messages are sent via BMS to
      the 4GL process which started the connector. The connector
      can also be started in inbound message handling mode from a
      currently running BVM.&nbsp; It is not necessary (but seems more
      practical) to start it from the OS command line.</p>
               <p class="Paragraph">Note: Inbound message handling is not yet implemented.</p>
