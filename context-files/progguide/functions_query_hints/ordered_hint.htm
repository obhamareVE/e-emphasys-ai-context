            <p class="Paragraph">The ordered hint advises the query processor to join the tables
               of the query in the order in which they are listed in the from
               clause. For example:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
select a.bpid, b.bpid
from   tccom100 a, tfgld106 b, tfacr200 c
where  b.bpid = a.bpid
and    b = c.bpid 
hint   ordered
</pre><p class="Paragraph">In this query, first table tccom100 should be joined with
               table tfgld106. The result of this should be joined with
               table tfacr200.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">An ordered hint does not give you the guarantee that the
               tables are actually joined in that order. In case you are
               working on the Oracle level-2 driver the hint is simply added
               to the Oracle query. Its effect depends on how Oracle
               interprets this hint. In case you are working on a level-1
               driver the tables are joined in the specified order if it
               does not conflict with any other fixed order that may exist
               due to a 'refers to' expression, a subquery or a company
               number expression. For example:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
select tppin020.cmbc
from   tppdm740, tppin020
where  tppin020.cmbc refers to tppdm740
hint   ordered
</pre><p class="Paragraph">On a level-1 driver the 'refers to' expression already
               dictates a fixed join order between the tables tppdm740 and
               tppin020. They cannot be joined in the order of the from
               clause, therefore the ordered hint has no effect. To make the
               ordered hint take effect you can substitute the 'refers to'
               expression with an 'equal' expression:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
select tppin020.cmbc
from   tppdm740, tppin020
where  tppin020.cmbc = tppdm740
hint   ordered
</pre><p class="Paragraph">Now the join can be performed in the hinted order.
               Replacing the 'refers to' expression may however not always
               be possible.
