            <p class="Paragraph">The query processor at the driver side fetches records from the
               RDBMS (e.g. Oracle). It does not directly send these records to the
               client (BShell) but buffers them in an internal 'RDS' bufffer. When
               this buffer is full the entire buffer is sent to the client. With a
               buffer hint you can specify the size of this RDS buffer for this
               particular query. The size of the buffer is specified in rows. For
               example:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
select a.bpid
from   tfgld106 a, tccom100 b
where  a.bpid refers to b
hint   buffer 100 rows
</pre><p class="Paragraph">Thus in the above example the buffer will be able to hold
               exactly 100 rows. The size of the buffer must be at least 1.
               The buffer size only holds for the hinted query.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">A buffer hint can be used for a query that selects a large
               set of records and when we need to process all of these
               records. In this case a large set of records has to be
               transferred from the driver to the client. It is more
               efficient to transfer a few large sets than transferring a
               large amount of small sets. However using a large buffer may
               not be beneficial in all cases. If a query selects a large
               set of records but we actually use only the first few records
               then buffering many rows may in fact be disadvantageous.
            </p>
