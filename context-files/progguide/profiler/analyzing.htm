            <p class="Paragraph">The Call Graph Profiler is a tool for performance analysis.
               	  Performance analysis is all about combining the knowledge of the business logic
               	  that is being executed and the Call Graph Profile that is collected with the
               	  available tools. Each of these do not lead to performance improvements easily;
               	  the combination of both can be very powerful.

            <p class="Paragraph">Some hints on how to determine whether there are improvement
               	  possibilities:
            </p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem">Match the object summary info against the expectation of the
                  		developer who knows the functionality of the session and/or business process.
                  		Unexpected patterns should be investigated. When the run time in some objects
                  		is much longer than the CPU time the reason should be investigated. The long
                  		run time may be because the application waits for user input. The long run time
                  		may also be because of long running SQL statements, in which case the next step
                  		might be an investigation of long running SQL statements.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">Look at the functions that are the most expensive in the <a href="../../progguide/profiler/output.htm#flat_profile" class="manualLink">Flat Profile</a>. If the cost is significant it may be useful to try to optimize
                  		  the implementation of these functions.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">Look in the <a href="../../progguide/profiler/output.htm#query_summary" class="manualLink">Query Summary</a> for SQL statements that have a long run time, or for SQL
                  			statements that have much higher number of fetch operations than
                  			expected.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">Walk through the <a href="../../progguide/profiler/output.htm#call_graph" class="manualLink">Call Graph</a> from the <code class="Code">main()</code> function. Look for details in child functions that contribute
                  			  significantly to the cost of the session. Remember your knowledge of the
                  			  business logic in the session and try to understand whether it is really
                  			  necessary to do the things you see and to do these things the number of times
                  			  you see them being done.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">Remember the numeric characteristics of the business
                  				process that was executed (e.g. 5 orders with 10 order lines each, in which 6
                  				different items play a role) and see if the number of calls in the sessions and
                  				dlls in the process match your expectations.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">If you see something that looks strange or that
                  				  unexpectedly takes a significant amount of time and you have no idea why it
                  				  happens or whether it can be improved, or if it is not 'your area' : do not
                  				  ignore it, but raise the issue with colleagues and figure out whether there is
                  				  an improvement possibility.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"></li>
               <li class="ListItem">When functions are called very often it may be
                  					helpful to walk a couple of levels up in the Call Graph, to the parent function
                  					and the parents parent function etcetera. The reason for the behaviour of the
                  					code may become clear by studying the various levels of the call stack. For
                  					example: a large number of fld.display() calls in the 4GL Engine may be related
                  					to a call to display.all() in a section of the UI script (e.g.
                  					when.field.changes:).
