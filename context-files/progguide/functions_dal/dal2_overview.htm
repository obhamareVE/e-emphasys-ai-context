            <p class="Paragraph">In Infor ERP Enterprise the DAL concept is introduced to centralize
               integrity checks. One of the goals is to be able to re-use these
               integrity checks rather than implementing them again and again.
               In practice however, it appears that these integrity checks are
               hard to re-use in the UI layer. As a result, a lot of business
               logic is programmed in the UI scripts. Another problem is that
               since developers often only test the application via the User
               Interface, the DAL on its own is not well tested.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">It also appeared that it is very hard to use the current DALs
               for Integrations via Baan OpenWorld, because too often business
               logic is spread across the DAL and the UI scripts.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The DAL2 concept is introduced to tackle these issues. With
               DAL2 a number of new hooks is introduced that make it possible
               to define the integrity checks in such a way that they are
               easier to re-use. One of the major benefits is that the <a href="../../progguide/glossary/glossary.htm#fourgl_engine" class="glossaryLink">4GL engine</a> now re-uses
               these hooks to perform automatic disabling/enabling of fields
               and commands.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">Another important improvement is that DAL2 makes it possible
               to define field dependencies in such a way that they can be used
               to determine correct values for fields that are not known by
               other components. Until now (in the Corelli Release), this was
               already possible for external products that Integrated with Infor
               ERP Enterprise using Baan OpenWorld. The DAL2 concept now makes it
               possible to re-use the field dependencies in the Infor ERP Enterprise
               application as well. Also, the <a href="../../progguide/glossary/glossary.htm#fourgl_engine" class="glossaryLink">4GL engine</a> makes use of
               the defined field relations in order to determine default values
               in the User Interface.
