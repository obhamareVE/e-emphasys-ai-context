            <p class="Paragraph">You use main table i/o sections to program actions that you
               want to be executed when read or write actions occur on the main
               table. These sections are not relevant to type 4 programs, as
               such programs do not have a main table. Main table i/o sections
               consist of a main section and a subsection. The main section is
               always <i class="Emphasis">main.table.io</i>. The subsection indicates when the actions
               must be executed.
