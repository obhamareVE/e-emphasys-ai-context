               processes.

            <p class="Paragraph">You use application locks to prevent other applications
               and users from reading and/or modifying an application's data
               during critical operations. For example, to prevent access to
               data when it is being updated.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">You can set an application lock only for the current 4GL
               process. You can test for or delete an application lock only
               within the application to which it applies.

               <li class="ListItem">Each application lock has an owner, which is
                  automatically assigned. The owner consists of a
                  combination of the login ID of the application user, and
                  the process ID of the application.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem">Each application lock has a unique name, which you

                  is not linked to a table or a particular database

            <div class="subSectionTitle">Application lock types</div>
            <p class="Paragraph">There are three main types of application locks:</p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem"><i class="Emphasis">Read locks</i> When you set a read lock, the owner of that lock has
                  only read access to the application's data. Other
                  applications can read and modify the data. Other users of
                  the application can set read and write locks on it. But
                  they cannot set an exclusive application lock.Each application can have several read-type application
                  locks.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"><i class="Emphasis">Write locks</i> When you set a write lock, the owner of that lock has
                  both read and write access to the application's data.
                  Other applications can read the data but not modify it.
                  Other users of the application can set read locks on it,
                  but not a write lock or an exclusive lock.Each application can have only one write-type
                  application lock. So you cannot set this type of lock when
                  there is a write-type or exclusive-type lock already
                  present.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem"><i class="Emphasis">Exclusive locks</i> When you set an exclusive lock, the owner of that lock
                  has exclusive access to the application's data. Other
                  applications and users can neither read nor modify the
                  data, nor can they set any application locks on it.You can set an exclusive lock only when there are no
                  other locks (of any type) already present.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Paragraph">There is one additional lock type, which you can combine
               with any of the other types:
            </p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem"><i class="Emphasis">Application-wide locks</i> Normally, an application lock is set for the current
                  company only. By using this additional lock mode, you can
                  apply the lock globally to all companies. This means that
                  the application lock is valid in all companies.
