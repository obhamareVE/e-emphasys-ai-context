            <p class="Paragraph">You use program sections to define functions, and to declare
               tables and global variables, that you want to use in the other
               sections in the script. You also use program sections to program
               actions that you want executed at the start and end of the
               report and after the report writer receives a record.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The following program sections are available. They are all
               main sections. There are no subsections associated with program
               sections.

               <p class="Paragraph">Use this section to declare tables and global variables that
                  you want to use in other sections in the report script. See <a href="../../progguide/3gl_features/declarations.htm" class="manualLink">Declarations</a> and <a href="../../progguide/3gl_features/tables.htm" class="manualLink">Tables</a> for details of the declaration syntax. Note that there is no
                  need to declare a table if a field of that table is defined in
                  the report writer as an input field. The report writer declares
                  such tables automatically.

                  when the report is started. For example, you can use this
                  section to initialize or import variables.

                  the end of the report. For example, you can use this section to
                  close files that were opened during execution of the report.
