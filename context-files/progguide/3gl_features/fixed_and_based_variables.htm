            <p class="Paragraph">A string variable can be declared as fixed so that its
               	      current length always equals the maximum length. When a shorter string is 
               	      assigned to such a string variable, it is right-padded with spaces.
               	      For example:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
STRING name(10)  FIXED
name = "andrew"       | the string now contains the value "andrew    ", not "andrew"
</pre><p class="Paragraph">The keyword FIXED is applicable to one-dimensional strings
               only. Multi-dimensional string arrays are always fixed and do
               not need to be declared with the keyword FIXED.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="GeneralSection">
            <div class="subSectionTitle">Based variables</div>
            <p class="Paragraph">The BASED mechanism is applicable to strings or arrays of
               all possible types. It determines that a variable will be
               based on another variable. For based variables, no memory
               space is reserved when they are declared. At runtime they use
               the same memory space as the variable on which they are
               based. So by using this mechanism, the same section of memory
               can be accessed via different names.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">You use the following construction to base one variable on
               another: <code class="Code">BASE var_1 AT var_2</code></p>
            <p class="Paragraph">In the case of a string, the based variable is always
               fixed. You must ensure that the based variable always fits in
               the variable on which it is based. So it will be safe to
               declare the basic variable as FIXED.

STRING a(10)    FIXED
STRING b(5)     BASED
BASE b AT a(3)        | This indicates that the space occupied

            <p class="Paragraph">The following points summarize the rules for variable and
               fixed length strings:
            </p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem">Strings with variable length are 1-dimensional strings
                  not declared as based or fixed. All other strings are
                  fixed- that is, database table fields, string arrays, and
                  variables declared as FIXED or BASED.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem">Normally, variable length strings are not filled up
                  with spaces except when a start position is specified in
                  the assignment.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem">Fixed length strings are always filled up with spaces,
                  except when a length is specified. In the latter case, the
                  remaining positions are not overwritten by spaces.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem">If a string (of variable or fixed length) is filled
                  from a certain start position, the part of that string
                  preceding the start position is filled up with spaces if
                  it was not filled before.
