            <p class="Paragraph">In a traditional installation all sessions essentially run under the same authorization. This
               changes drastically in e.g. a multi-tenant environment, where the landlord has a very different authorization compared 
               to the tenants. Tenants may under no circumstance be able to execute a session which might influence another tenant.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">Therefore a differentation is made between trusted and non-trusted object files. A trusted object file may still do everything,
               just like
               in a traditional installation. A non-trusted object, however, is limited in the functions it may execute. Some bshell functions
               
               are not allowed in non-trusted objects (such as 'shell'), nor are calls to functions in trusted objects allowed (unless these
               are explicitly 
               allowed by adding 
               the '@trusted' keyword). Typical examples of trusted objects are the applications as provided by Infor. Typical examples of
               non-trusted objects
               are objects compiled by the user, based upon user generated sources, such as reports.
