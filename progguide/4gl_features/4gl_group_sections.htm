            <p class="Paragraph">With dynamic forms, the mapping of groups to forms is not fixed.
               	  Consequently, the only form sections that are relevant to dynamic forms are the <i class="Emphasis">form.all</i> and <i class="Emphasis">form.1</i> sections. When
               	  dealing with dynamic forms, you use group sections instead of form
               	  sections
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">You use group sections to program actions that you want to be
	  executed when a particular group is activated or ended. Group sections consist
	  of a main section and a subsection. The main section specifies the particular
	  group(s) for which the actions are to be executed. The subsections specify when
	  the actions must be executed – for example, when the group is activated or when
	  the group is ended.</p>
            <p class="Paragraph">Note that a group becomes active when the form on which it
               	  occurs becomes current.

               <p class="Paragraph">This section defines the group for which the actions
                  		programmed in the group subsections are executed. The group number is
                  		automatically generated when the group is created and can be obtained from the <a href="../../progguide/glossary/glossary.htm#dfe" class="glossaryLink">DFE</a>.

                  		the first time the group becomes active, immediately before the <i class="Emphasis">before.group</i> subsection. You use this subsection to
                  		program the first action to be performed by the system when the group becomes
                  		active. When the group is split across two or more forms (because not all the
                  		group fits on one form or because it is a repeating group), this subsection is
                  		executed the first time that the first form on which the group occurs becomes
                  		current.

                  		is reserved and represents a super group, containing all other
                  		groups.
