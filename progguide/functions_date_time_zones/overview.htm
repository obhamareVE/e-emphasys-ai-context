            <p class="Paragraph">Infor ERP Enterprise provides time-zone independent date and time support.
               	  The user interface always shows local dates and times. Internally, however, Infor
               	  ERP Enterprise stores dates and times in Universal Coordinated Time
               	  ( UTC).
               	  It represents
               	  both date and time in a single integer value referred to as the UTC long format.
               	  This integer value represents the number of seconds since UTC time 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970.
            </p>

            <p class="Paragraph">The UTC functions described in this section support conversion
               	  between local dates and times and UTC. Users can set their local time zone via
               	  the user interface. 3GL/4GL programs can modify the time zone at runtime using
               	  various time zone functions.

            <p class="Paragraph">Infor ERP Enterprise handles week numbering according to ISO:5601. Week 01
               	  is the week that includes the first Thursday of the year or January 4 . Monday
               	  is the first day of the week (that is, day 1). Sunday is the last day of the
               	  week (that is, day 7).
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">In the company-data settings in the data dictionary it is
	  possible to define the first day of the week (that is, day 01) for individual
	  Infor ERP Enterprise users. If a user’s first day of the week is Monday, then week
	  numbering follows the ISO standard. However, if a user’s first day of the week
	  is other than Monday (Sunday or Wednesday, for example), the week number is
	  calculated differently. The week number is always the ISO week number of the
	  Monday that occurs in the user’s week.</p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The following diagram illustrates this:</p>
            <div class="Figure"><img src="../images/date_time_zones_example.gif" alt="[...]" height="225" width="484"></div>
            <p class="Paragraph">In the example, the user’s first day of the week is a Wednesday.
	  The week number of the week beginning Wednesday 9 and ending Tuesday 15 &nbsp;is the
	  ISO week number for the Monday that occurs in that week. The ISO week number of
	  Monday 14 is week 6, so Wednesday 9 to Tuesday 15 is week 6.</p>
