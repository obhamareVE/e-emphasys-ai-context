         <div class="GeneralSection">
            <p class="Paragraph">The Process Change Manager (PRCM) offers a generic mechanism
               that allows a 3GL process to notify one or more other 3GL
               processes about a certain state change.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">A good example would be one or more sessions that should
               refresh their data as soon as another session has done updates
               in a certain database table. The session that performs these
               table updates, has to inform the others about this in one way or
               another. PRCM allows you to do this.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">PRCM is very usefull in the following cases:</p>
            <ul class="List">
               <li class="ListItem">A change in one process requires changing others, but you
                  don't know how many processes need to be informed.
               </li>
               <li class="ListItem">When a process should be able to notify other processes
                  without having to know these processes.
               </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="Paragraph">In the example above, the session that notifies the other
               sessions does not have to know which sessions should be
               notified. It also does not have to know how many sessions have
               to be notified.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="GeneralSection">
            <div class="subSectionTitle">Design and implementation</div>
            <p class="Paragraph">PRCM is based on the so-called Observer Design Pattern (also
               known as Publish-Subscribe). It works as follows:
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">Processes can have an Observer role, and/or a Subject role.
               Observers register (i.e. subscribe) themselves for a certain
               Subject. By registering themselves, Observers indicate that they
               want to be informed about state changes in the Subject. If a
               Subject changes, it will notify all interested Observers about
               that change. Observers then decide whether and how they react on
               the notification.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">PRCM is implemented in such a way that Observers and Subjects
               do not communicate with each other directly, but via a so-called
               Change Manager. This Change Manager keeps track of all
               registrations and peforms the notification of all Observers on
               behalf of the Subject.
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="GeneralSection">
            <div class="subSectionTitle">Automatic notification of maintable updates</div>
            <p class="Paragraph">Informing other sessions about updates done on the maintable
               is perhaps the most obvious application of the Process Change
               Manager functionality. For this reason, the <a href="../../progguide/glossary/glossary.htm#fourgl_engine" class="glossaryLink">4GL engine</a> automatically notifies sessions when the maintable has been
               updated via choice UPDATE.DB. (In case the session performs
               updates directly on the maintable then the session should notify
               other session itself).
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The 4GL engine notifies other sessions by calling <a href="../../progguide/functions_prcm/prcm.notify.htm" class="manualLink">prcm.notify()</a>, 
               passing the main table code to it, e.g. prcm.notify("tccom100") for Business
               Partners. Sessions that are interested in changes in the
               maintable, have to register themselves in order to be notified.
               For implementation details see the <a href="../../progguide/functions_prcm/examples.htm" class="manualLink">Process Change Manager Code Examples</a> section.

               <p class="Paragraph">Do not call <a href="../../progguide/functions_prcm/prcm.notify.htm" class="manualLink">prcm.notify()</a> for 
                  the maintable in the <i class="Emphasis">after.update.db.commit</i> section or the <a href="../../progguide/functions_dal/after.commit.transaction.htm" class="manualLink">after.commit.transaction()</a> hook of the DAL of the maintable, as this interferes with the automatic notification of the <a href="../../progguide/glossary/glossary.htm#fourgl_engine" class="glossaryLink">4GL engine</a>.
