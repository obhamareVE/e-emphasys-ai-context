            <p class="Paragraph">The <a href="../../progguide/functions_processes/wait.htm" class="manualLink">wait()</a> function enables synchronization of parent and child processes.
               It causes the parent process to wait for one or all of its
               children to exit before continuing. Each child process sends an
               exit signal to the parent process when it ends.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">The parent can choose to ignore child signals or not. If it
               wants to ignore child signals, the parent process calls:
            </p><pre class="CodeBlock">
signal(SIGCHLD, SIGIGN)
</pre><p class="Paragraph">If it does not want to ignore child signals, it calls:</p><pre class="CodeBlock">
signal(SIGCHLD, SIGNOIGN)
</pre><p class="Paragraph">When a parent process issues a <a href="../../progguide/functions_processes/wait.htm" class="manualLink">wait()</a> call
               but is ignoring child signals, child processes exit without any
               action by the parent. They exit, send an exit signal to the
               parent, and are removed. The parent process blocks until it
               receives an exit signal from the last process. The exit value
               and process ID of the last child are returned in the return
               value and <i class="Emphasis">prodess_id</i> argument respectively of the <i class="Emphasis">wait()</i> function. The following diagram illustrates this
               situation.

            <p class="Paragraph">When a parent process issues a <a href="../../progguide/functions_processes/wait.htm" class="manualLink">wait()</a> call
               and is not ignoring child signals, the exit signal of every
               child process is caught by the <i class="Emphasis">wait()</i> function (including
               exit signals from children in other process groups). So, each
               child waits after exiting until its parent process calls the <i class="Emphasis">wait()</i> function. While it is waiting for the parent
               process to catch its exit value, the child process becomes a
               zombie process. It is placed in the terminating process queue,
               but is not removed until the parent catches its exit signal. The
               following diagram illustrates this situation.

            <p class="Paragraph">Note that if a parent ends while some of its children are
               zombie process, those children are removed automatically.
